# The Paradigm Shift of the Workspace Because of Digital

> Or something similar. The gist of it being that we previously changed what a few, specific departments did. But now digital changes how everybody works. Because digital is now the most important dimension within which the business operates.

## The length of the feedback loop

Shortening the feedback loop - the time it takes between a company releases a product, a service, a feature or a message, and between they get signals back from the customer about that release - is changing not only the way development teams work, but how the business as a whole can operate. And because competitors and disruptors are using this shortening of the feedback loop to decrease their time to market of offerings and updates, customer oriented tweaks, to those releases, a given company has no choice but to start changing their work processes to enable them to make use of the shortening.

## The size of a 'piece of work'

In order to harness the power of a shorter feedback loop, a company needs to change the way they think about 'projects' and about 'strategy'. The main reason being that you can't get the benefits of a shorter loop if a given piece of work takes longer to do then the lenght of the feedback loop.

## Changing the view of knowledge

Another bastion that has to be fundamentally changed is the internal view of the company's knowledge about its industry and its customers. Because the previous paradigm of really long feedback loops is very recent, this is a shift in perspective that is very important to introduce as soon as possible. In the old paradigm you had to build up 'knowledge' internally which you acted on during the long, initial period when all work on a project, a product or a message was internal. This long internal period of course had the effect of making the evaluation of the knowledge selfserving. Also, after the internal development phase was over, and a product or a message was ready for release, the cost of distribution for this release was very high. As an example, in communications the cost of distribution normally was four times higher than the production cost of the messeage, the cost of developing what was going to be distributed. In other words, there was a grave financial punishment for getting it wrong. Because of what can be compared to old paradigm's distribution costs, it was also expensive to aggregate knowledge. This was a function of inferior research methods and analogue operations alike.
